# Weather Website 🌤️  

Welcome to the Weather Website! This is a simple and interactive website that lets you check the weather for any city. It’s designed to be easy to use, fast, and visually appealing.  


## Why We Used an API  

You might wonder how the website knows the current weather in your city. That’s where an **API** (Application Programming Interface) comes in!  
- We used a weather API to fetch real-time data like temperature.  
- APIs save us the hassle of maintaining huge weather databases. Instead, they connect us to reliable data sources that are always updated.  
- For this app, we used the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which provides accurate and detailed weather information.  


## What Can You Do with This Website?  

- **Check Weather Anywhere**: Just type in a city name, and you'll get its current weather instantly!  
- **Real-Time Updates**: Get the latest temperature, weather description, and other details like humidity and wind speed.  
- **User-Friendly Design**: The app works on all devices, whether you’re on a computer or your phone.  



## How It Works  

1. Open the website.  
2. Type a city name into the search bar.  
3. Click the "Search" button.  
4. The website shows:  
   - Current temperature 🌡️  
   - Weather description (e.g., cloudy, sunny, rainy) 🌧️  
   - Humidity and wind speed 💨  




## Technologies Behind the Scenes  

Here’s what makes the website tick:  
- **HTML**: The backbone of the website (structure).  
- **CSS**: Makes the app look beautiful and responsive.  
- **JavaScript**: Handles the dynamic parts, like fetching data and updating the weather info.  
- **Weather API**: This is where we get the live weather data.  



## What’s Next?  

Here’s what we plan to add in future versions:  
- Hourly and weekly weather forecasts.  
- A weather map feature to visualize different weather conditions.  
- Automatic location detection so the app can show your weather without typing anything.  
- Cool animations for weather icons.
